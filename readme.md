# marine-db

ECMAScript 2018 source code for standardising, validating, and publishing [Norwegian Polar Institute](https://npolar.no)'s [marine biological data](https://doi.org/10.21334/marine-db).

The [marine-db](https://github.com/npolar/marine-db) project aims at providing data on the web following [best practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/) for publishing [linked open data](https://lod-cloud.net).

Primary biodiversity is published as [Darwin Core RDF graphs](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/rdf/), expressed in [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), but is also available as tab-separated [Darwin Core text](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/) files, and in line-separated JSON.
